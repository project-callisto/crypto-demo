  <h2 class="main-header text-centered">Introduction</h2>
  <p><a href="https://projectcallisto.org" target="_blank">Callisto</a>is a nonprofit organization that detects serial perpetrators of sexual assault and professional sexual coercion. We do via a reporting platform that enables survivors to submit an entry identifying their perpetrators. This information can only be decrypted by a Callisto Legal Options Counselor (a lawyer) if another survivor identifies the same perpetrator (a match). If there is a match, the Legal Options Counselors assigned to each of the survivors will decrypt the identity of the serial perpetrator and their assigned survivor, and will reach out to them to discuss their options towards pursuing justice. Communications between Legal Options Counselors and survivors, including information in the entry, are confidential and protected by attorney-client privilege.</p>
  <p>It is critical that any reporting tool for sexual assault and harassment protects the data of both the victims and the accused. This demo application aims to show some of the advanced cryptographic techniques that Callisto uses to ensure a safe and trusted reporting experience.</p>
