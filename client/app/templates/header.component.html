  <div class="starter-header-3">Callisto is a nonprofit organization that develops technology to combat sexual assault and harassment. Our online systems are designed to detect repeat perpetrators and to empower victims to make the reporting decision right for them. Victims can input the identity of their perpetrators into a matching system; this information is held encrypted in escrow unless another victim names the same perpetrator. If there is a match, the Callisto Legal Advocate will reach out to the victims to discuss their options towards pursuing justice.</div>
  <div class="starter-header-3">Protecting the data of both the victims and the accused is very important to Callisto. This demo app aims to show the advanced cryptographic techniques that Callisto uses to ensure a safe and trusted reporting experience. </div>
